## An Admonishment
I had an experience tonight that reminded me of what a twisted world that we live in. I would like to encourage you all to hold onto what is good, true, and beautiful and life, ultimately finding these things in God. Do not compromise your morals or values for anything subpar, but rather dedicate yourself to a morally upright worldview. Despite the difficulties of this view, it must be recognised that the world, now more than ever, needs men and women to live GOOD lives, not with the goal of pleasure and fun. Please, if you are willing, pray for the world and the state of your own soul. 


May God bless you all abundantly. I am keeping you in my prayers
