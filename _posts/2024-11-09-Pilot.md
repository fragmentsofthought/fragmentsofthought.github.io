## Pilot

I'm not making this for people to read. I'd like to make it clear that I think that not everybody should have the right to declare their thoughts to the audience of the online global stage. This is simply a means of expression, ideally to a private audience of one; myself. But, to introduce myself apart from the header of my blogpage, I am an a Christian, an aspiring English teacher, a developing musician, and a young man in pursuit of philosophical understanding.

But, don't expect too much from this page. It's active so long as I need it.
